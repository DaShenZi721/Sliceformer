We implement Sliceformer based on [Sinkformer](https://github.com/michaelsdr/sinkformers), and you can download the datasets from [here](https://github.com/michaelsdr/sinkformers).

To run image classification experiments, modify [config.py](https://github.com/DaShenZi721/sliceformer/blob/master/sliceformer/vit-pytorch/config.py) and execute [one_expe_mnist.py](https://github.com/DaShenZi721/sliceformer/blob/master/sliceformer/vit-pytorch/one_expe_mnist.py).

For text classification experiments, you can run [one_expe.py](https://github.com/DaShenZi721/sliceformer/blob/master/sliceformer/nlp-tutorial/text-classification-transformer/one_expe.py).
